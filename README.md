# FRDE
A mathematical framework to decompose systemic risk in India's Nifty 500 index into fundamental factors (Value/Momentum/Quality) using linear algebra. The engine:

- Processes 500+ dimensional stock data into latent risk factors via covariance eigendecomposition
- Achieves >80% variance explanation with just 3 orthogonal factors using PCA dimensionality reduction
- Quantifies stock-specific factor exposures through eigenvector projection
- Visualizes factor regimes and structural breaks in Indian equity markets
